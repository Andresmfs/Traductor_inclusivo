# Traductor_inclusivo
We create a model that, given any spanish text as an input, it provides an inclusive and grammatically correct version of the text. 

It has been developed with a QLoRA fine-tuning of the LLM [Aguila-7b](https://huggingface.co/projecte-aina/aguila-7b) on the dataset [es-inclusive-language](https://huggingface.co/datasets/somosnlp/es-inclusive-language).

All the information about the model in the [model card](https://huggingface.co/somosnlp/es-inclusivo-translator).
